## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.12] - 2025-11-06

### Fixed
- 🐛 **Critical: Reef Broadcast Agent Invocation** - Fixed issue where @agent decorated functions were not being invoked when reef.broadcast() was called
  - Agents now subscribe to both their own channel AND the default broadcast channel
  - Prevents duplicate invocations through handler delegation
  - Unblocks Phase 3B agent processing pipeline

### Changed
- Enhanced agent subscription mechanism in @agent decorator
- `ReefChannel` handler invocation already supported both scenarios

### Testing
- Added comprehensive test suite: `tests/test_reef_broadcast_fix.py` (12 tests)
- Tests cover: basic invocation, multiple agents, no duplicates, custom channels, concurrency, regressions
- All 89 tests passing (12 new + 53 decorator + 24 reef)

### Technical Details
- **Modified**: `src/praval/decorators.py` (~10 lines)
- **Added**: `tests/test_reef_broadcast_fix.py` (445 lines)
- **Breaking Changes**: None - fully backward compatible

### Impact
- ✅ Agents now correctly receive broadcasts from reef.broadcast()
- ✅ Unblocks entire Phase 3B agent processing pipeline
- ✅ Enables proper spore-based communication patterns
- ✅ No regressions to existing functionality
