    "\n",
    "Welcome to this interactive tutorial on building AI agents with Praval! This notebook will guide you step-by-step through creating intelligent, collaborative agent systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Your First Agent** - Understanding agent identity and the `@agent` decorator\n",
    "2. **Agent Communication** - How agents talk to each other via spores\n",
    "3. **Using Chat & LLMs** - Integrating AI models into your agents\n",
    "4. **Tools for Agents** - Extending agent capabilities with custom tools\n",
    "5. **Memory-Enabled Agents** - Building agents that remember and learn\n",
    "6. **Specialist Collaboration** - Creating teams of specialized agents\n",
    "7. **Knowledge Base Integration** - Building expert agents with domain knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "## Praval Philosophy\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Like coral reefs in nature, complex intelligence emerges from the collaboration of simple, specialized agents.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of building monolithic AI systems, Praval lets you create ecosystems of specialized agents that collaborate naturally. Each agent has a clear **identity** and **purpose**, making your code easier to understand, test, and extend.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🎉 Congratulations!\n",
    "\n",
    "You've completed the comprehensive Praval agent-building tutorial. Here's what you can now do:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Skills\n",
    "✅ **Create agents** with identity-driven design using `@agent`  \n",
    "✅ **Agent communication** through spores and message types  \n",
    "✅ **Use LLMs** intelligently with `chat()` and proper fallbacks  \n",
    "✅ **Extend capabilities** with custom tools using `@tool`  \n",
    "✅ **Build memory** into agents for learning and continuity  \n",
    "✅ **Design specialist teams** that collaborate naturally  \n",
    "✅ **Create expert agents** with domain knowledge bases  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identity over Behavior**: Define what agents ARE, not just what they DO\n",
    "2. **Specialization**: Each agent excels at one thing\n",
    "3. **Self-Organization**: Agents coordinate without central control\n",
    "4. **Emergent Intelligence**: Complex behaviors from simple interactions\n",
    "5. **Composability**: Agents combine naturally through standard interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Praval Philosophy\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Like coral reefs in nature, complex intelligence emerges from the collaboration of simple, specialized agents.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of building monolithic AI systems, you now build ecosystems of agents that work together naturally."

    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explore Advanced Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out these production examples in the `examples/` directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **VentureLens** (`venturelens.py`)\n",
    "   - Flagship example: AI business analyzer\n",
    "   - Multi-agent interview and report generation\n",
    "   - Professional PDF output\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Knowledge Graph Miner** (`knowledge_graph_miner.py`)\n",
    "   - Advanced multi-threading\n",
    "   - Concurrent agent processing\n",
    "   - Complex knowledge structures\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **RAG Chatbot** (`rag_chatbot.py`)\n",
    "   - Document processing and embedding\n",
    "   - Retrieval-augmented generation\n",
    "   - Conversational AI\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Numbered Examples** (`001_*.py` through `011_*.py`)\n",
    "   - Progressive complexity\n",
    "   - Specific patterns and techniques\n",
    "   - Best practices in action\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Patterns to Master\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pipeline Pattern**: Sequential specialist processing\n",
    "2. **Parallel Pattern**: Multiple agents working simultaneously\n",
    "3. **Hub Pattern**: Coordinator distributing work\n",
    "4. **Recursive Pattern**: Agents creating sub-agents\n",
    "5. **Observer Pattern**: Monitoring and logging agents\n",
    "\n",
    "### Build Your Own\n",
    "\n",
    "Try building these real-world applications:\n",
    "- Content creation pipeline (research → write → edit → publish)\n",
    "- Data analysis team (collect → analyze → visualize → report)\n",
    "- Customer service system (triage → solve → escalate → follow-up)\n",
    "- Learning platform (assess → teach → practice → evaluate)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Documentation**: Check `docs/` directory for detailed specs\n",
    "- **Philosophy**: Read `praval.md` for design principles\n",
    "- **Community**: Join discussions and share your agents!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remember\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to master Praval is to build. Start small, experiment freely, and let emergent intelligence surprise you!\n",
    "\n",
    "Happy agent building! 🚀"
